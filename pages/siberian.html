    <h1>Siberian Tiger</h1>
    <p><img class="siberian-image-1" src="../images/siberian/tiger_1.jpg" alt="">The Siberian tiger, a subspecies of
      tiger, is
      the largest cat in the world. It averages about 3.3 m (11 ft.) in
      length, with a tail measuring 1 m (3 ft.). Adult male Siberian tigers can weigh up to 320 kg (700 lb.), while
      females are significantly smaller, weighing up to 180 kg (400 lb.).</p>
    <p>Siberian tigers are distinguishable by their striped fur. Similar to people's unique fingerprints, no two tigers
      have the same striped pattern. Siberian tigers differ from other tigers because they have fewer, paler stripes,
      and they also have manes. The mane, in addition to their thick fur, helps keep them warm.</p>
    <p>Also known as the Amur tiger, the Siberian tiger resides in a small region in the southeast region Russia. They
      are also located in small numbers in China and North Korea.</p>
    <p>Siberian tigers are solitary animals, marking their scent on trees to keep other tigers away. They roam many
      miles and hunt often. They stalk their prey, which include elk, boar, bears, and deer, until they are close enough
      to pounce. When successful, they drag their kill to a secluded area before devouring the meat.Tigers also hunt
      smaller animals like rabbits, pikas, and fish.</p>
    <p>Because tigers are not always successful on their hunts, they need to hunt often. They can eat up to 27 kg (60
      lb.) if they are very hungry, but generally they eat about 9 kg (20 lb.) of meat in one sitting.</p>
    <p><img class="siberian-image-2" src="../images/siberian/tiger_2.webp" alt="">The gestation period in Siberian
      tigers is
      3-3.5 months. Female
      tigers give birth once every two years at any
      point during the year.</p>
    <p>A litter consists of two to six cubs. The mother tiger will care for the cubs by herself, at times, leaving the
      babies alone while she hunts. Often she cannot catch enough food for the cubs, and some will die.</p>
    <p>At 3 months, the babies will be able to leave the den; they may even go on hunts with their mother. At 18 months
      old, they are able to hunt on their own, but will not leave their mother's den. When they reach 2-3 years old,
      they will leave the den and begin life on their own.</p>
    <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>Siberian tigers are considered endangered by IUCN's Red List. One cause of their dwindling population is loss of
      habitat due to deforestation. In addition, Siberian tigers are poached, or illegally hunted, for their fur and for
      body parts that are used for traditional medicines.</p>
    <p>Efforts have been made to curb poaching of tigers and to protect tiger habitats. Many countries, including the
      United States, have created laws that outlaw the importation and selling of tiger parts. There are also breeding
      programs to help sustain the tiger population.</p>
